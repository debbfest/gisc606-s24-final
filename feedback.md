What was your favorite part of the class?
That you were so receptive to our feedback. My kid would need my attention a few times during class and I'd blink then become immediately lost in the code that was missed so I depend on the recorded videos A LOT. Pushing the due date for assignments until midnight still gave me that saturday to work on the lab that was due so I'm eternally grateful for that! 

What was your least favorite part of the class?
Initially was trying to follow along as quickly as you can code.  I felt like if I didn't get the code correct the first time, you'd move on and I couldnt get back on track. I didn't want to ask questions during the class for fear of holding everyone else behind so I'd just rely on the recordings like I mentioned above, so that's the easy solution. 

Do you have any suggestions for how the instructor could improve the class experience for future students?
Encourage students to turn on their camera! You're right when you say that it feels so cold and impersonal to talk to a silent screen and I wanted to turn my camera on but didn't want to be the only one :')
