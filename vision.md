What is your "dream" GIS/tech job?
Ideally, I'd love the opportunity to do sabermetrics aka baseball statistics. Specifically though, I'd like to do spatial statistics and analytics related to baseball.

What GIS applications or technologies excite you most?
I'm most excited about the integration of augmented reality (AR) into GIS applications because it offers immersive visualization and real-time data overlay. Gives off Ironman vibes in real life.

What GIS skills/techniques or non-GIS hobbies would you like to focus on after this semester ends?
Crafting! I don't have nearly enough time these days (masters, work, new baby, life, etc. etc.) I want to fix my sewing machine and get back into embroidery or even just cross stitching if I can't get my old machine fixed.
